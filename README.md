# Quibble Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension designed for designers and developers to compare design mockups against the actual coded implementation. Perfect for QA testing, design reviews, and ensuring pixel-perfect implementation across different screen sizes.

## Purpose

Quibble bridges the gap between design and development by allowing you to:
- **Overlay design mockups** directly on live websites

   - Set design order (1 = first, 5 = last)
   - Click "Upload Image" and select your design file
   - Repeat for different screen sizes or design variations

3. **Organize by Screen Size:**
   - Upload designs for different breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Set appropriate orders for each design
   - The extension will automatically select the best match based on current screen size

### Comparing Designs with Implementation

1. **Load the Live Website:**
   - Navigate to the website you want to compare against
   - Open Chrome DevTools and go to the "Quibble" tab

   - **Mobile**: Long press the overlay to enter focus mode, then drag
   - Adjust transparency using the slider to see both design and implementation clearly

4. **Test Responsive Behavior:**
   - Resize your browser window to test different screen sizes
   - The extension will automatically select the best design match
   - Compare how the design looks against the actual responsive behavior

### Managing Design Assets
